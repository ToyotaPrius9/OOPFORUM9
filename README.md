1.A) A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects, whereas the instantiation of a class refers to the process of creating an actual object. In the given scenario, we can consider the salesman as a class that has attributes such as name, ID, and sales. This salesman class represents the blueprint or template. When we create/hire a new salesman, it is an instance of the class, this procerss would be called as an instantiation of a class.

1.B) One example of how the principle of inheritance can be used in this scenario, is if the company had a base class called "employee" wherein employee contains attributes like ID, salary, and name. And so the class "salesPerson" can inherit from the class "employee" and have additional attributes such as sales performance or commision rates. The salesPerson inherits from employee and has it's own additional attributes, making the use of the principles of inheritence. 

Another example would be the company having the base class called "products" wherein the products they sell will inherit attributes from it. For instance, an electronic product inheriting from the class "products" would have additional attributes such as power intake (wattage, voltage, etc).

1.C) Libraries can help in development programs of the company by saving it time by re-using pre-defined classes without having to manually create everything again and again, it helps significantly in efficiency.

2.Ci) ![image](https://github.com/ToyotaPrius9/OOPFORUM9/assets/114371673/d15eb795-9f9e-41bb-87fc-853d8cac6a31)

2.Cii) If changes would be needed in the future, it could not change. This is due to the absence of mutator methods. 

2.D) 102

2550.40
5000.00

2.h) One good suggestion for the calculations or payroll to be made is to have an extra attribute in the SalesPerson class to keep track of all their information, along with a new method that estimates their salary by summing up all of their sales in the month.

2.i) Polymorphism can be seen in the SalesPerson class when it's using method overloading in the making of the two constructors.
