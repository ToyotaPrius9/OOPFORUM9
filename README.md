A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects, whereas the instantiation of a class refers to the process of creating an actual object. In the given scenario, we can consider the salesman as a class that has attributes such as name, ID, and sales. This salesman class represents the blueprint or template. When we create/hire a new salesman, it is an instance of the class, this procerss would be called as an instantiation of a class.
